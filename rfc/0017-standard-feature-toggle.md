## Summary

This RFC proposes a possible standardized way to synchronize feature toggles (boolean values) between the client and server.


## Motivation

Currently, there are no convenient methods to implement toggleable features without using tedious custom payload packets.

However, it is impossible to write a common server mod to disable certain features in mods. This RFC aims to standardize client-server feature control.


## Explanation

### Details

The idea is to create an API for mods to register features with, so servers can explicitly disable said features enabled on clients.

When a client joins a server, it sends a packet that describes what features are available.

Mods can ask the server to authorize features or disable them entirely.

### Networking Specification

To standardize this feature toggle system it needs a standardized networking specification so anyone can re-implement it with a custom API for different modding platforms (Spigot, Sponge, Forge, etc).

The networking specification is divided in multiple parts:
 - networking types
 - networking packets

All types used are either defined in this RFC or are used in MC's own networking. `S->C` means Server to Client and `C->S` means Client to Server.

In this specification, the type `string` without parenthesis describes an UTF-8 string with a maximum length of `32767`.

### Array `A[]`

An array holds a list of values of the specified type.
It also contains the size `N` of the array.

| Fields | Type     | Description                                 |
|:------:|:--------:|:--------------------------------------------|
| size   | [VarI32] | The size of the array.                      |
| 0      | A        | The first element of the array if present.  |
| 1      | A        | The second element of the array if present. |
| ...    | A        | An element of the array if present.         |
| N-1    | A        | The N-1 element of the array if present.    |

#### FeatureList

| Fields    | Type     | Description                                                     |
|:---------:|:--------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------:|
| namespace | string   | The namespace of the features. Can be considered the modid too. |
| features  | string[] | The features inside the given namespace.                        |

#### FeatureAuthorization

Can be described as an enum with two possible values: `ALLOW` or `DENY`.

 - `ALLOW` means that the client should follow the user configuration's and is allowed to enable the related feature.
 - `DENY` means that the client is forbidden to enabled the related feature.

In networking this can be represented as a boolean with `ALLOW` being `true` and `DENY` being `false`.

#### Feature

Represents a feature with an authorization value.

Can be seen as a tuple of a string for the identifier path, and a [FeatureAuthorization].

#### FeatureOverrideList

Represents a list of features with authorization values.

| Fields    | Type     | Description                                                     |
|:---------:|:--------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------:|
| namespace | string   | The namespace of the features. Can be considered the modid too. |
| features  | [Feature]\[\] | The features inside the given namespace.                        |

#### `quilt:available_features` packet

Describes the available features on the client to the server. This packet can be split into multiple packets.

Direction: `C->S`

| Fields      | Type              | Description                                                     |
|:-----------:|:-----------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------:|
| expect_more | bool              | Determines whether the server should expect follow-up packets or not. If a `quilt:available_features` packet is sent after a similar packet which had `expect_more` field set to `false`, then it should override the feature list. |
| features    | [FeatureList]\[\] | The features available on the client.                           |

#### `quilt:features_override` packet

Describes the overriden features on the client by the server. This packet can be split into multiple packets.

Direction: `S->C`

| Fields      | Type                      | Description             |
|:-----------:|:-------------------------:|:-----------------------:|
| features    | [FeatureOverrideList]\[\] | The features overrides. |

### Who implements it?

In the case of Quilt, this would likely be its own QSL module, or integrated in the QLS networking module.

In the case of other modding platforms, anyone is free to re-implement the protocol and offer an API.

## Drawbacks

This could add an extra burden to some mod developers and the QSL.

It could also place too much trust into the client which should be avoided as the number one1 rule of client/server relationships is do not trust the client.


## Rationale and Alternatives

- This design allows for a generic server-mod to disallow/allow features due to the standardization.
- If we do not implement a standard feature toggle, then mods allowing servers to disallow/allow features will be more rare thus pushing some server admins to be way more strict about mods.


## Prior Art

 - [LambdaControls networking](https://github.com/LambdAurora/LambdaControls/wiki/LambdaControls-Networking#lambdacontrolsfeature)


## Unresolved Questions

- Is the `quilt` namespace appropriate for this networking specification?
- How can the networking specification be improved?


## Expected Response

The wider community might respond positively to this change, hopefully. This RFC aims to simplify the life of some mod developers and server administrators.  
Cheat/hacked mod developers will most likely straight up ignore this feature altogether due to their nature.
